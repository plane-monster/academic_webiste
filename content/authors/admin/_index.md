I am currently a fourth-year student pursuing applied mathematics in a dual program offered by the University of Birmingham and Jinan University. My primary academic interest is in resource management within the field of IoT, especially focusing on edge computing and serverless computing. Besides, I am passionate about participating in Kaggle competitions and warmly welcome individuals to join my team for collaborative endeavors in Kaggle competitions. Additionally, I am thrilled to share that I will be advancing my education at the University of Pennsylvania in September 2024, where I will be pursuing a Master's degree in Systems Engineering.
